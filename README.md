# data_cleaning
An SQL data cleaning project

## Introduction
A faux dataset of club member information.  This is a project that can be used to practice data cleansing using SQL, Excel or any other method.  This small project was inspired by a post made by [Sushanta Khara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ksushant/) on LinkedIn.

## Problem Statement

In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis.  'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading results.  Garbage in = garbage out.

These are the some steps that can be taken to properly prepare your dataset for analysis.

- Check for duplicate entries and remove them.
- Remove extra spaces and/or other invalid characters.
- Separate or combine values as needed.
- Ensure that certain values (age, dates...) are within certain range.
- Check for outliers.
- Correct incorrect spelling or inputted data.
- Adding new and relevant rows or columns to the new dataset.
- Check for null or empty values.

Using the criteria above, create a new SQL table with the properly formatted data.

## Datasets used

The initial columns and their type in the provided CSV file are:
- full_name : text
